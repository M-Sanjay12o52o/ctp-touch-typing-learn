export const story = `Once upon a time in a small, quiet village nestled in the valley of towering mountains, lived a young girl named Elara. She had an insatiable curiosity and spent most of her days exploring the lush green forests and sparkling streams that surrounded her home. Unlike other children in the village, Elara loved solitude, for she found joy in the whispers of the wind and the rustle of leaves under her feet. One sunny morning, as she wandered deeper into the woods than ever before, she stumbled upon a hidden path covered in moss and lined with vibrant wildflowers. Something about it beckoned her, and with a mixture of fear and excitement, she decided to follow it. The path led her to a clearing where stood an ancient tree with a trunk so wide that it seemed to touch the sky. At its base lay a shimmering golden door, adorned with intricate carvings of mythical creatures and strange symbols. Elara’'s heart raced as she reached out to touch it. As her fingers brushed the cool metal, the door creaked open, revealing a staircase that spiraled downward into darkness. Without a second thought, she stepped inside, her adventurous spirit overpowering her caution. What she discovered in the depths of the tree was a world unlike any she had ever imagined—one filled with glowing plants, talking animals, and mysteries that promised to change her life forever.
